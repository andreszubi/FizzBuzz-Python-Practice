# FizzBuzz Python Practice

A classic FizzBuzz implementation in Python. This program prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a common programming interview question and a popular coding exercise. The task is to:
- Print numbers from 1 to 100
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
- Otherwise, print the number itself

## How to Run

Simply execute the Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Output

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
...
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Implementation Details

The program uses a simple loop with conditional statements to check divisibility by 3 and 5, printing the appropriate output for each number in the range 1-100.
